<h1>Dev setup</h1>

<p>Unless you want to set the key in the interface, create a .env with <b>WEBCOOS_API_KEY=""</b> for the server to utilize WebCoos API</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>Run <b>flask_app.py</b> to start the server and go to <b>http://localhost:5000</b> or the local address in the console for the webpage.</p>

<p>Currently loaded model is not that good. Next process is properly saving results and finally running better iterations of the model/advanced model configuration</p>
